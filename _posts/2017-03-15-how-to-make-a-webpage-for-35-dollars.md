# {{page.title}}

There are a couple of thing you will need in order to have your own web page. Here I will show you step by step, how to do it spending as little as 35 dollars.

# Who is this for?

I wrote this tutorial with non-developers in mind, if you are a developer/programmer/designer you might not need to read all the tutorial just go for the sites that I recommend and you can pretty much figure out everything else.

For everyone else, take your time going through each step, some of this info will look really complex but in reality it is pretty simple, I'm going to try my best to explain everything so anyone can do it.  

If you have any question regarding this tutorial you can tweet me [@blodvodhr](https://twitter.com/blodvodhr) or opening an issue on [https://github.com/AndreGtz/blog/](https://github.com/AndreGtz/blog/)

# Let's get started adquiring our Domain name  

If you have never created or uploaded a website you might be wondering what a Domain name is and how to adquire one for yourself. Well you can read the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) about it. If that doesn't make it clear basically it is your www.mypage.com thing, you have to pay to have your own "url".

You can find lot of retailers on google by searching "domain name". I'm going to explain how to register your domain with GoDaddy just because it's my preferred choice and it has a good international covegare. In Godaddy you can get a .com domain for 15USD per year.

To begin with use their search tool to find if your name is available, I'm going to search for mypage:
![mypagegif]()
Which returns me all the names available for my name or a little variation of my name.

**Which one is the best?**
The easiest one to remember it's going to be always **.com**, it is the universal domain for internet.

You can come out with clever domains like: make.it , which is more creative than makeit.com.

If you are making your personal page with your porfolio in it, you can use myname.me.

There are a ton of domains, just search the list of posible domains and pick the one you think fits better for your purpose.

Register your domain. So you have picked one (maybe more), this is where half of the money goes to, you will need to register an account on godaddy and give godaddy your full name, address, phone number, etc. This info will be public if people request the WhoIs for your domain name. Godaddy offers to hide your information for about $2. If your privacy concerns you, go ahead an pay for it, otherwhise just take note that your info will be exposed on internet.

# Hosting  
Github pages it's my choice of hosting for static web pages. It is complex to upload your web page to it, but if you follow my steps you can totally do it.

Create an account at github.com, we are going to use it later.

# CSS Themes / Design  
If you are a designer you probably already have your webpage all set and ready to uploading, if you are like me, you will probably need to buy a theme or contract a designer to design your awesome page.

Here are some sites I go to buy themes for my pages:

# Stock Pictures  
Most modern web pages have those awesome pictures on the background, they all have something in common: they are big, they are high-res and they are expensive... or not.
I have a curated list of sites where you can get free stock pictures with creative and commons license with free comercial use for anything you want.

# SSL  
Getting a ssl certificate costs about $60 per year, but there are other options.
Easiest one is to create an account at cloudflare and use the free service of one domain with ssl.
Harder is to use letsencrypt.org to generate your own certificate for free.

# Using your template to actually show your info  

# Mounting your site on github pages  
## Creating the project  
## Uploading your content  
## Setting the domain name  
## Setting the ssl  
## Modifing your site inside github
