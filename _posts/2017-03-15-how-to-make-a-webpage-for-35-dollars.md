There are a couple of thing you will need in order to have your own web page. Here I will show you step by step, how to do it spending as little as 35 dollars.

# Domain name  
It's the only thing you cannot get for free. I'm going to explain how to register your domain with GoDaddy just because it's my preferred choice.

In Godaddy you can get a .com domain for 15USD per year.

Register your domain.

# Hosting  
Github pages it's my choice of hosting for static web pages. It is complex to upload your web page to it, but if you follow my steps you can totally do it.

Create an account at github.com, we are going to use it later.

# CSS Themes / Design  
If you are a designer you probably already have your webpage all set and ready to uploading, if you are like me, you will probably need to buy a theme or contract a designer to design your awesome page.

Here are some sites I go to buy themes for my pages:

# Stock Pictures  
Most modern web pages have those awesome pictures on the background, they all have something in common: they are big, they are high-res and they are expensive... or not.
I have a curated list of sites where you can get free stock pictures with creative and commons license with free comercial use for anything you want.

# SSL  
Getting a ssl certificate costs about $60 per year, but there are other options.
Easiest one is to create an account at cloudflare and use the free service of one domain with ssl.
Harder is to use letsencrypt.org to generate your own certificate for free.

# Using your template to actually show your info  

# Mounting your site on github pages  
## Creating the project  
## Uploading your content  
## Setting the domain name  
## Setting the ssl  
## Modifing your site inside github
