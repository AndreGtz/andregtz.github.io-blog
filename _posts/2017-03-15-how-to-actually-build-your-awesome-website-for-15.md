# {{page.title}}


You are an entrepreneur, a professional looking for job or maybe you just need a simple website.

This tutorial applies to static webpages, if you have a web app, then you actually need more money. 

If you want a blog, then this tutorial is not for you, it can be done with the same budget but it needs a whole tutorial on its own. Maybe I will make a tutorial for that later.

If you have looked around there are a ton of options for creating your own website, but nothing is free, and you can end up spending about $200 on your website.

Here I will show you step by step, how to do it spending as little as 15 dollars.

# Who is this for?

I wrote this tutorial with non-developers in mind, if you are a developer/programmer/designer you might not need to read all the tutorial just go for the sites that I recommend and you can pretty much figure out everything else.

For everyone else, take your time going through each step, some of this info will look really complex but in reality it is pretty simple, I'm going to try my best to explain everything so anyone can do it.  

If you have any question regarding this tutorial you can tweet me [@blodvodhr](https://twitter.com/blodvodhr) or opening an issue on [https://github.com/AndreGtz/blog/](https://github.com/AndreGtz/blog/)

# Let's get started: Adquiring your Domain name  

A domain name is the web address that points to your website.

You can find a lot of sites to register your domain name by searching "domain name" on google. 

I'm going to explain how to register your domain with GoDaddy just because it's my preferred choice and it has a good international covegare. 

In Godaddy you can get a .com domain for 15USD per year.

To begin with use their search tool to find if your name is available, I'm going to search for *mypage*:
<iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ImperturbableScrawnyDamselfly' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='640' height='357' allowfullscreen></iframe>
Which returns all domains available for "mypage" or a little variation of "mypage".

## Which one is the best?  

.com is the most used domain, smartphones tend to have a special key [.com], and most people will add a .com when browsing for your site. 

You can come out with clever domains like: make.it , which is more creative than makeit.com.

If you are making your personal page with your porfolio in it, you can use myname.me.

There are a ton of domains, just search the list of posible domains and pick the one you think fits better your purpose.

As a recommendation first buy .com, and if you really like others buy them as well.

If you go for make.it, make sure to buy make.com and/or makeit.com, so if people enter those domains you can forward them to your domain make.it.

## Register your domain  

So you have picked one (maybe more), now you will need to register an account on godaddy and give godaddy your full name, address, phone number, etc. 

This info will be public if people request the WhoIs for your domain name. Godaddy offers to hide your information for about $8. 

If your privacy concerns you, go ahead an pay for it, otherwhise just take note that your info will be exposed on internet.

Make your purchase and move on to the next step.

# Hosting: Where your files are going to live. 
Github pages it's my choice of hosting for static web pages because it is free and you can edit all your files inside of github without needing an editor. 

It's use is more oriented to programmers, but don't let this discourage you, once you get the hang out of it, it's going to be your (and your pocket) best friend.

For now create an account at [Github](https://github.com/), we are going to use it later.

# The design
If you are a web designer you probably already have your webpage all set and ready to uploading, if you are like me, you will probably need to buy a theme or contract a designer to design your awesome page.

Unless, you take the time to search for free templates.

Here are some sites I go to search themes for my pages:
- [html5up](https://html5up.net/) free templates
- [themeforest](https://themeforest.net/category/site-templates/) templates for sale <$20 and give you support
- [templated](https://templated.co/) free templates

Some of them are free others cost you less than $20.

If you choose a free template checkout the autors site and see if you can donate, they are giving away their hard work for you to use it freely, it is nice to reward them whenever you can.

# Stock Pictures: A powerful resource to make a normal website, beautiful  
Most modern web pages have those awesome pictures on the background, and they all have something in common: they are big, they are high-res and they are expensive... or not.

I have a list of sites where you can get free stock pictures with creative and commons license with free comercial use for anything you want.

- [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
- [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) you can search here photos from other sites like unsplash and pixabay.

Since you are getting them for free, I invite you to donate to the authors and communities for their hard work.

# SSL: The security aspect  

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard technology to make an encrypted link between your server and the client, so all the information that is shared between the two of them is secure.

## Do I need a SSL Certificate?

3 reasons to have a SSL Certificate:

1. If you are getting data from users then you must have a SSL Certificate otherwise their data could be compromised.

2. Having a SSL Certificate improves your score on search engines, so your website can appear higher.

3. It builds trust on your visitors.

If you don't need anything from those reasons you can live without it.

Getting a SSL Certificate costs about $70 per year (like on godaddy), but there are other options.

Easiest one is to create an account at [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/) and use the free service of one domain with ssl.

Harder is to use [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) to generate your own certificate for free.

It is ok to use cloudflare for free when you have a small page and almost no traffic, but if you grow larger remind yourself to come back and start paying for the $20 plan that gives you added security and better performance.

If you choose letsencrypt.org I urge you to donate a bit to them, they are making a service which costs more than $50 yearly for free. They need the donations to continue to provide this service for free.
